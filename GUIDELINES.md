#guidelines to contribute

**In the early stage of the project these guide lines will be followed softly but in later stages will be 
enforced.**
<br>

The developers those who want to contribute will try to comply to pep8 coding style guidelines.
The points to follow are:
+ Direct merging to the `master` branch is prohibited.
+ A `development` branch or `v X.X.X` branch will be created for the actual development purpose.
+ If any experimental feature has to be worked on then creating different branches can be done.
+ If a new branch is created , add or update the `README` file stating the purpose of that branch.
